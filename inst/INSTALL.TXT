EQUINOX Super Serial Technology Installation Notes
-------------------------------------------------- 

This is a loadable Linux driver for the SST based multiport serial boards. The
driver is available for Intel ix86, Intel IA-64 platforms and x86_64 platforms
(AMD64 and Intel EM64T).  It supports the ISA, EISA and PCI versions of
the two, four, eight and 16 port boards, the expandable 64 and 128 port boards,
and the 4RJ and 8RJ boards.
ISA and EISA are not available on IA-64 (Itanium) and x86_64 systems.

Installation
------------

The Equinox Super Serial Technology (SST) software is distributed as a
standard source RPM.  
  
There are several steps required to do the full installation from the
source RPM.  These can be done automatically by using the installation 
script eqnx-cfg or by manually performing each step.  The directions for 
both procedures are described below.

It is generally recommended that automatic installation using eqnx-cfg be
used.  

Automatic Installation Using eqnx-cfg
-------------------------------------

The eqnx-cfg script will perform all of the steps necessary to install the
Equinox SST eqnx product.  Plus it will also validate the target environment
which would indicate potential problems when building the driver.

NOTE: this is the recommended procedure to install the eqnx product.

From a terminal (console) window, do the following:

	1. Optionally, remove existing RPM package, if installed:
	   (an existing RPM may also be upgraded by using the -U option
	   to eqnx-cfg as mentioned in step #4).
	   rpm -ev eqnx -or- eqnx-cfg -vr

	2. Obtain and locate the product release.  This may be 
	   obtained via ftp from the Equinox web-site (www.equinox.com), 
	   by floppy disk or cd-rom.

	   For floppy disk or cd-rom, mount the distribution media and cd
	   to the correct directory:

	   for floppy disk:
	   a. mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
	   b. cd /mnt/floppy

	   for cd-rom:
	   a. mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
	   b. cd /mnt/cdrom/TARS/LINUX

	   NOTE: device name and mount points may vary between systems.

	3. Un-tar the image.

 	   mkdir /tmp/eqnx
	   cp eqnx-4.12d.tar /tmp/eqnx
	   cd /tmp/eqnx
	   tar -xvf eqnx-4.12d.tar
		
	4. Install the eqnx product using eqnx-cfg:

	   The simple procedure to install using eqnx-cfg:
	   ./eqnx-cfg

	   The script will also take options and parameters as follows:
	   ./eqnx-cfg [-U] [-v] [-o parms] [-d rpmdir] [eqnx-4.12d-1.src.rpm]

	   The -U (upgrade) option will upgrade an existing eqnx product.

	   The -v (verbose) option provides additional information during
	   the installation.

	   The -o (other parms) option is used to provide additional parameters
	   to the rpm command.  

	NOTE 1: On systems such as Debian, Slackware and Gentoo, the rpm
	operation will fail due to dependency problems.  On these systems,
	the "-o --nodeps" option should be used.

	   The -d (RPM directory) is used to specify the toplevel RPM
	   directory, such as /usr/src/redhat.  Generally this option 
	   will not be required, this value will be determined automatically.

	   The source RPM may be specified, otherwise it will attempt to
	   locate and use a source RPM within the current directory.

	5. The eqnx-cfg creates a log file, /var/tmp/eqnx-log.  If the
	   installation fails, please read the log file.

	6. If a distribution media was mounted, unmount it:

	   cd /
	   umount <mount directory>	(/mnt/floppy, /mnt/cdrom, etc.)

	NOTE 2: The installation will attempt to modify the system scripts
	so that the driver will be automatically loaded at boot time.  If
	this cannot be done automatically, the operator must manually make 
	the change to ensure that the /usr/sbin/rc.espx script is invoked
	at boot time.  

	"/usr/sbin/rc.eqnx start" will load the driver and start operation.
	"/usr/sbin/rc.eqnx stop" will terminate esp operations.

Manual Installation
-------------------

From a terminal (console) window:

	1. Obtain and locate the release package.  This may be obtained via ftp
	   from the Equinox web-site (www.equinox.com), by floppy disk or
	   cd-rom.

	   For floppy disk or cd-rom, mount the distribution media and cd
	   to the correct directory:

	   for floppy disk:
	   a. mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
	   b. cd /mnt/floppy

	   for cd-rom:
	   a. mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
	   b. cd /mnt/cdrom/TARS/LINUX

	   NOTE: device name and mount points may vary between systems.

	3. Un-tar the image.

 	   mkdir /tmp/eqnx
	   cp eqnx-4.12d.tar /tmp/eqnx
	   cd /tmp/eqnx
	   tar -xvf eqnx-4.12d.tar
		
	4. Install the source rpm:

	   rpm -ivh eqnx-4.12d-1.src.rpm

	5. Build the binary rpm:

	   rpmbuild -bb <rpm directory>/SPECS/eqnx.spec
	   
	NOTE 3: For systems with rpm utilities prior to version 4.0,
		"rpm -bb" should be used instead of rpmbuild.
	NOTE 4: The location of the RPM directories may vary between systems.
		Typical locations are listed at the end of this section.

	6. Install the binary rpm:

	   rpm -ivh <rpm directory>/RPMS/{arch}/eqnx-4.12d-1.{arch}.rpm

	NOTE 5: the 'arch' value will vary based on distributions.
	NOTE 6: an upgrade of an existing RPM can be done by using the
		upgrade, -U option to the rpm instead of the -i option.

	7. Load driver and create device files:

	   /usr/sbin/rc.eqnx start

	NOTE 7: if an upgrade was done and the previous product was
		older than 4.03, then the "restart" option must be used
		instead of "start".

	8. Make the driver loaded and initialized at boot time:

	   This varies based on distribution:
	   a. [for systems with chkconfig (Redhat, Mandrake, TurboLinux, etc)]
	      chkconfig --add eqnx
	   b. [for systems with /etc/rc.d/rcN.d directories (Suse, 
	       Caldera, etc)]
	      cp /usr/sbin/rc.eqnx /etc/rc.d/eqnx
	      ln -s /etc/rc.d/eqnx /etc/rc.d/rcN.d/S90eqnx
	      (where N=2,3,4,5)
	   c. [for systems with /etc/rcN.d directories (Debian, etc)]
	      cp /usr/sbin/rc.eqnx /etc/init.d/eqnx/S90eqnx
	      ln -s /etc/init.d/eqnx /etc/rcN.d
	      (where N=2,3,4,5)
	   d. [for systems with /etc/rc.d/rc.local (Slackware, etc)]
	      add "/usr/sbin/rc.eqnx start" to /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
	   e. [for Gentoo]
	      manual set-up is required.  Refer to NOTE 2.

	   Alternatively, the script /usr/sbin/eqnx-installrc will attempt
	   to install the eqnx startup script appropriately based on
	   distribution.
	      
	9. If a distribution media was mounted, unmount it:

	   cd /
	   umount <mount directory>	(/mnt/floppy, /mnt/cdrom, etc.)

	Typical RPM directories:
	Redhat		/usr/src/redhat
	Mandrake	/usr/src/RPM
	Suse		/usr/src/packages
	Debian		/usr/src/redhat
	TurboLinux	/usr/src/turbo
	Slackware	/usr/src/rpm
	Gentoo		/usr/src/redhat

KERNELSRC and KERNELOBJ Override
--------------------------------

Regardless of whether a manual installation or an automatic installation, 
using eqnx-cfg, is being done - the build scripts will attempt to locate and
use the kernel source that corresponds to the running kernel.

In some cases, the kernel source path chosen may be incorrect.  There are
environment variables that may be used to specify the kernel source location.
	KERNELSRC = location of kernel source.
	KERNELOBJ = location of kernel object, if different from KERNELSRC.

Installation Components
-----------------------

As a result of standard RPM installation, the following will be installed:

	* eqnx driver source			/var/tmp/eqnx-build/src/drv
	* eqnx diagnostic utilities source	/var/tmp/eqnx-build/src/utils
	  (ssmkn, ssrm, ssdiag and sstty)
	* diagnostic utilities 			/usr/bin
	  (ssmkn, ssrm, ssdiag and sstty)
	* install script, eqnx-cfg		/usr/sbin
	* configuration information		/etc/eqnx
	* startup script			/usr/sbin/rc.eqnx

The eqnx driver and utilities will be built and installed during
the installation of the binary RPM package.

Kernel Rebuild
--------------

The driver will be built using the include files for the current kernel.
As a result, the correct source must be installed on the system or the
build will fail.  In addition, the kernel source must be configured to
match the current kernel (particularly, CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_MODVERSIONS).

NOTICE:
In order to reduce the probability of installation or operational problems
it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that the following procedure be followed:

	1. Install appropriate kernel source.
	2. Configure the kernel as required.
	3. Re-build the entire kernel (and modules).
	4. Install and re-boot using the new kernel.
	5. If there are no problems, install the Equinox SST driver.

The actual steps for configuring, building and installing a kernel will
vary based on distribution.

Removal
-------

The eqnx package can be un-installed using standard RPM tools (for
example by "rpm -ev eqnx" at a command prompt).  This removes
all components of the package and unloads the driver.

The eqnx package can also be un-installed using eqnx-cfg -r.  This optionally
will also remove the RPMs and data used to build the eqnx RPMs.

The removal will fail if the driver cannot be unloaded.  This is almost
always because the driver is being used by other processes.
Typically, this would be getty or mgetty processes
but it could be other processes as well.  These processes must be
terminated before the removal can succeed.

Upgrade
-------

An upgrade from an existing release can be done.  An upgrade will fail
if the existing driver is in use.

For manual installations, use the -U option when installing the binary
RPM.  

For installations using eqnx-cfg, the -U option should be specified when
invoking eqnx-cfg.

Dependencies
------------

The rpm package has a built-in dependencies on perl and ncurses.  For
some distributions, ncurses-devel is also required.

It is also a requirement that the rpm and rpm-devel packages are installed.

SMP Systems
-----------

In order to properly run the SST driver on a symmetric multiprocessing 
system (SMP), two patches must be applied to the standard Linux kernel
in order to make the tty sub-system properly multi-threaded. 

1. Prior to the linux 2.2.15 kernel, serial port data could get lost
   if a port writer and a port reader were running concurrently on a
   multiprocessor system.  The fixes are in the following kernel files
   from the linux patchset #15:
	/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/n_tty.c
	/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/tty_io.c
	/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c
	/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/ppp.c
	/usr/include/linux/tty.h
	/usr/include/linux/if_pppvar.h

   This problem has been corrected in linux kernel releases 2.2.15 and
   later and also in linux 2.4 kernels.

2. Serial ports can get into a "hung" state if a port writer and a port
   reader are running concurrently on a multiprocessor system and 
   "canonical" mode processing is used.  This has been fixed in 2.4 
   kernels.

Driver Rebuilding
-----------------

Driver source is installed at /var/tmp/eqnx-build/src/drv.  This is used to 
build a kernel module which can be dynamically loaded or unloaded from
the running system.  The driver object will be installed at

	2.2 kernels: /lib/modules/REL/char			
	2.4 kernels: /lib/modules/REL/drivers/char
	2.6 kernels: /lib/modules/REL/drivers/char

	where
		REL = Linux kernel version number

During installation the driver will be rebuilt based on the system
environment (kernel version number and SMP information).

To manually rebuild the driver (must be running as root user):

	1. cd /var/tmp/eqnx-build/src
	2. cd drv
	3. make clobber 
	4. make install

Note that rebuilding the kernel will NOT cause the eqnx driver to be
automatically rebuilt and installed.

Diagnostic Utilities
--------------------

The diagnostic utilities ssdiag, sstty and ssmkn are dependent on
the system environment and are rebuilt automatically during installation.

To manually rebuild these utilities:

	1. cd /var/tmp/eqnx-build/src
	2. cd utils
	3. make clobber 
	4. make install

Number of SST boards
--------------------

The number of cards the driver can handle is set by the MAXBOARD 
variable in the file linux.h (in the eqnx driver directory: 
/var/tmp/eqnx-build/src/drv).  The default number is 4.

By setting the MAXBOARD to the number of SST cards in the system, the driver 
will only allocate the memory that is required and the major numbers
will not be wasted.  After modifying this variable, the driver must be 
rebuilt and installed as described in "Driver Rebuilding".

IMPORTANT: Please note the MAXBOARD variable can be increased to a maximum of
8 as the driver can only handle a maximum of 8 SST based cards in the system.

	A set of 128 minor numbers are reserved for each card starting with 
	zero. An example of a four card configuration would be,

	card 1: SST-64P/64	(1 SSP64 ASIC)
		device names with major and minor numbers,
		/dev/ttyQ1a1	50 0
		/dev/ttyQ1a2	50 1
		.
		.
		.
		.
		/dev/ttyQ1d16	50 64

	card 2: SST-64P/8	(1 SSP64 ASIC)
		device names with major and minor numbers,
		/dev/ttyQ2a1	50 128
		.
		.
		.
		.
		/dev/ttyQ2a8	50 135

	card 3: SST-4I/8	(2 SSP4 ASIC)
		device names with major and minor numbers,
		/dev/ttyQ3a1	51 0
		/dev/ttyQ3a2	51 1
		.
		/dev/ttyQ3a4	51 4
		.
		.
		/dev/ttyQ3a8	51 7

	card 4: SST-64I/64	(2 SSP64 ASIC)
		device names with major and minor numbers,
		/dev/ttyQ4a1	51 128
		.
		.
		.
		.
		/dev/ttyQ4h16	51 255

Even though it is possible to create these devices using the mknod 
command, The utility "ssmkn" can create these devices. It maintains a database 
of the configuration and knows when the devices have been added or removed or 
moved. 

The utility "sstty" gives additional capabilities in terms of using 
CTS/RTS flow control, switching DTR, moving board memory for ISA cards and 
more information like board configuration, ISA memory holes, etc.

ISA Boards and I/O Ports
------------------------

ISA boards must be assigned an I/O port address and a 16K ISA memory region.
The ISA port address is assigned between 0x200 and 0x3f0.  The ISA memory
region is a paged 16K slot in the range 640K to 1M.  The ISA cards do not use
IRQs.

There are three primary methods used to assign these resources.  In order of
reliability, the methods are :

	1) Configure I/O address using dip switch on board
	2) Configure board for Plug-and-Play and enable PnP mode in BIOS
	3) Configure board for Plug-and-Play and disable PnP mode in BIOS

The following sections cover these methods.

ISA Boards and Configured I/O addresses
---------------------------------------

NOTE: This is the recommended method of configuring the board.

Each ISA board has a jumper and a 4-position dip switch.  Position the jumper
so that "SWITCHES" is selected (not "PLUG & PLAY") and configure the dip
switch to select an appropriate I/O port address.  For more information, 
refer to the appropriate hardware reference manual.  The dip switches are 
only used to select an I/O port address.

The ISA memory location will be determined automatically or can be assigned
to a specific address.  This is determined by the "MegAddr" address.  
A value in this variable forces the driver to set ISA boards to use a 16K 
memory window at this address.  Otherwise, the driver will try to find a
memory hole automatically. If the board does not seem to work with the
automatically generated address, the "MegAddr" variable can be set to 
a usable 16K ISA hole.  Note that the default for "MegAddr" is 0, i.e.
automatically find a memory hole.

The value of "MegAddr" can be specified by modifying the file "linux.c"
int the driver directory (/var/tmp/eqnx-build/src/drv).  The driver will
then need to be re-built as described in "Driver Rebuilding".

If the automatically generated address does not work properly, the sstty
utility may be used to locate and test ISA memory holes.  "sstty -i" will
list potential ISA holes and their availability.  "sstty -v" can be used
to locate the board to a different ISA memory hole (the result can be found
in the log file /var/log/messages).  Note that this is only temporary and
will not be preserved across system reboots.  

If the automatically generated address does not work properly and a
usable ISA memory hole has been located, then the variable "MegAddr" in the
linux.c file (under driver directory) should be set to this address.  

ISA Boards and Plug and Play
----------------------------

To enable Plug-and-Play mode select "PLUG & PLAY" with the jumper.  In 
Plug-and-Play mode, the dip switch is not used.  If the system BIOS supports
it, the most reliable option is to enable Plug and Play mode in the BIOS
(i.e. do not select PnP OS).

ISA Boards and Plug and Play with the Linux Kernel
--------------------------------------------------

The last option is to select "PLUG & PLAY" mode on the board and have the
Linux kernel perform the Plug-and-Play configuration.  

The Linux kernel must be configured for Plug-and-Play.  In addition, the
board configuration may need to be provided, i.e.

Linux 2.2 kernels -
	The isapnp tools must be configured to enable ISA SST board(s).
	Generally, this is done as follows:

		pnpdump -c > /etc/isapnp.conf
		edit /etc/isapnp.conf
		there will be an entry for each equinox PnP board -
		  - the port line can generally be left alone.
		  - the memory line is either a range (MODE wr) or a limit
		    (MODE wu).
		  - for 2I, 4I, 8I and 16I boards, uncomment the range line
		    (MODE wr) and comment out the limit line (MODE wu).
		  - for 64I and 128I boards, uncomment the limit line (MODE wu)
		    and comment out the range line (MODE wr). 
		    Note - this is the default.
		reboot the system.

Linux 2.4 kernels -
	ISA plug and play is automatic.  Please note - 64I and 128I boards
	do not work correctly with linux 2.4 kernels.

If there is a problem with ISA Plug-and-Play with the Linux kernel, please
use a different method for configuring your SST board.

Initializing SST driver and device files
----------------------------------------

During system startup, several operations must be done before a SST
can be accessed:

	* the driver module must be loaded.
	* device files must be created.

The script to do these operations is in /etc/rc.d/init.d/eqnx.
This script is automatically invoked to initialize or terminate the driver
while booting or changing init states.

The script can also be invoked manually for various operations as described
below:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/eqnx start	(initialize driver + device files)

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/eqnx stop	(terminate driver, rm device files)

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/eqnx restart	(equivalent to stop followed by start)

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/eqnx status	(status of driver, number of active ports)

Device Files
------------

The device files provided for SST devices have:
	* names of the form /dev/ttyQN

	where N represents the portname extension of the form 
	<adapter card><module><port>.

	<adapter card> is a single number between 1 and 8. The adapter card 
	numbers are assigned in slot order or IO address sequence according to
	the type of card.(ISA/PCI/EISA)

	<module> is a single letter from 'a' through 'h' representing the port
	modules in the case of expandable cards. For the multiport cards, they
	are always 'a'.

	<port> is a decimal number between 1 and 16. It is the actual port 
	number on the port module for the expandable boards or the fanout
	cables for the 2, 4 or 8 port boards.

	An example of a port name will be /dev/ttyQ2b14. Here "2" is the second 
	equinox board, "b" is the second port module connected to the 
	expandable board and "14" is actual port on the port module.

The major number for the device files is dynamically chosen at run time.
On a running system, the value selected can be obtained by displaying
the /proc/devices file.

Each major number can handle two SST cards with 128 ports each.
The default is set to handle four SST based cards. 
 
Terminal and Modem Setup
------------------------

Configuring SST ports to be used for terminals or modems is the same
as for other standard serial ports.  Getty(1m) is used to initialize
and control terminals and mgetty(8) is used for modems.  Normally, 
initialization is done by adding a getty/mgetty entry for each port
in the /etc/inittab file.  Each getty/mgetty line references a 
gettydefs(5) entry which specifies the speed and tty settings that
will be used.

Please note: newer distributions of Linux (such as RedHat 7.2) have
replaced getty with agetty.  Refer to the appropriate manual page.

Note that HUPCL must be specified in the gettydefs entry for a terminal
or modem in order to have the port disconnected after the last process
closes.

For more information, refer to the system manual pages for getty (or agetty),
mgetty and gettydefs.

Printer Setup
-------------

Configuring SST ports to be used for printers is also the same as
for other standard serial ports.  However, it should be noted that 
the standard Linux tools generally do not do this well.

The following provides a short setup guide for serial printers:

1. Add the printer using the standard administration tool for your
   Linux system (such as printtool).  

   This adds a new printer entry to the file /etc/printcap.

2. Edit the file /etc/printcap.

3. For the new serial printer add a baudrate specification, using
   the 'br' function, such as:
   	:br#9600:\ 

4. If necessary, specify parity and flow control for the serial printer.
   Unfortunately, there are two different ways of doing this based on the
   version of the line printer software installed.  To determine which
   operations to use, it best to read the printcap(5) to see which
   functions are provided on your system.

   a. Older versions of lp services (such as provided by RedHat 6.2 and
      earlier):

      Flow control and parity settings are done by specifying a set of
      termio bits to clear using the 'fc' function and a set of bits to
      set using the 'fs' function.

      No parity:
   	:fc#0400:\

      Even parity:
   	:fs#0400:\
	:fc#01000:\

      Odd parity:
   	:fs#01400:\

      Hardware flow control (must be combined with parity commands):
   	:fs#020000000000:\

      An example entry in /etc/printcap (even parity, 19200):

      lp:\
	:sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp:\
	:mx#0:\
	:br#19200:\
   	:fs#0400:\
	:fc#01000:\
	:sh:\
	:lp=/dev/ttyQ01e0:\
	:if=/var/spool/lpd/lp/filter:                                             

   a. Newer versions of lp services (such as provided by RedHat 7.0 and
      later):

      Flow control and parity settings are done by specifying a set of
      stty attributes:

   	:stty parenb parodd ixon -crtscts:\

	-or-

	:stty -parenb ixon crtscts:\

      Note that the 'fc' and 'fs' attributes must NOT be specified 
      when using the newer version of the lp services. 

For more information, refer to the system manual pages for printcap
and the HOWTO guide for printers.

Serial Programming Guides
-------------------------

The best source for information on how to use serial devices can be
found in the Linux HOWTO documents.  These may be installed on the
target system.  Typically, they are located at /usr/doc/HOWTO.
They can also be found on the internet at the Linux Documentation Project
website (http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/index/html).

Recommended HOWTOs would be:

	* Serial-HOWTO
	* Serial-Programming-HOWTO
	* Modem-HOWTO
